# DetectingCommunityStructure

We present an urban network that takes into account
how resources and neighborhoods interact and influence
each other. This two mode matrix of urban structure presents an
approach to analyze urban structure. We identify an American
city community resources with in a neighborhood, construct a
network map based on the spatial location of these resources
and apply network centrality measures and clustering analysis
to evaluate the network structure. We examine the measures to
see what effect the urban structure has on such features as income
distribution, life expectancy, density and housing considerations.
As the science of cities comes into focus and emerging markets are
being completely developed in lieu of developing organically, the
results presented here will make recommendations for effective
metropolitan growth standards and the impact resources in a
community might have on a population.
